# Tutorial on Aggregated Power System Optimization Models


## System Requirements:
- Python 3 (tested on 3.9 but should work on 3.10 too)
- Libraries: look at the environment configuration file
- A LP solver, even an **open source** one like GLPK (https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/)

## Installation Instructions

These instructions are meant to be hassle-free and do not constitute the best practices; those who know Python can look at the environment.xml file and manually install the requirements. In case you don't have a solver installed in your machine, please follow the instructions to install and configure GLPK.

### Installing a Solver on Windows
1. Go to https://sourceforge.net/projects/winglpk/
2. Download the latest version of the GLPK binaries
3. Extract the contents in the folder of your choice
4. Add the w64 folder from the glpk installation to the *Path* system variable, as indicated in the picture
